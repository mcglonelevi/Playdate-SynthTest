# Synth Test

## A dev helper for generating playdate synth tones

I was working on adding sounds to a game and wanted a quick way to generate synth tones to help me find the tone I was looking for more quickly.

## Instructions

Compile the Source directory with pdc and load it on your simulator. You should be able to side-load it to a physical device if you have one. See up-to-date info for sideloading on PlayDate's website https://play.date
